                        I‚Äôm a frontend developer obsessed with creating web-apps.
                        My journey as a front-end developer started more than a year ago and gets more interesting every day.
                        Apart from writing code I also create designs for my projects so it makes a creative-thought process much easier.
                        I‚Äôm looking forward to get into backend and mobile development so it will expand my abilities of creating cool and helpful projects.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-xl text-white/50">
                        I‚Äôm playing guitar for almost a year. Mostly I play songs of the bands like: Metallica, Rammstein, Linkin Park, Anthrax.
                        Looking forward to learn some music theory but I‚Äôm a bit lazy for this üòÖ.
                        For the moment my biggest achievement is that I can play ‚ÄúMaster of puppets‚Äù but there is a lot of room for progress

                        I‚Äôm doing photography for more than 3 years now and share photos on my instagram page.
